# Enhancing the Checkout Flow in Silpo Online Store through User-Centered Design.

This is the repository for the thesis project "Enhancing the Checkout Flow in Silpo Online Store through User-Centered Design." completed by Mariia Sitarchuk under the supervision of Kateryna Kamianets.
It is based on the stages of Design Thinking technique, which was used for the project’s workflow.

## Important links

The result of the project is the set of prototypes of enhanced parts of the Silpo online store app's interface in checkout flow and additional ideas, that were generated based on the users' pains and needs research results.
Here are the links to the resulting prototypes:

## Artefacts

### Empathy
This phase focused on gathering essential insights to comprehensively understand the existing state of Silpo's online platform and to identify prevalent user challenges. To achieve this, I undertook several key activities: heuristic audit of the Silpo online store's platforms, competitive analysis of comparable online retailers, moderated usability testing and interviews with both experienced and novice users, and a broad survey on online grocery shopping habits. 

In this folder you can find:
* Document with the competitors analysis
* Proof of moderated usability testing and interviews
* Document with the interview scripts for experienced and inexperienced users
* Document with the usability testing scripts for experienced and inexperienced users
* Document with the results of moderated usability testing and interviews
* Document with the results of SUS evaluation of system state
* Document with the answers to the survey (in Ukrainian)
* Document with the answers to the survey (in Ukrainian)

The results of heuristic audit and competitive analysis can be found in the common Figma file in the “As is state” tab.


### Definition

This stage focused on getting the full picture of received information from the previous stage and stating the main problems faced by the user.

In this folder you can find:
* Three user personas of Silpo
* Customer journey maps for focused pathes of use


### Ideation

This stage focused on generating ideas of enhancement based on personas and findings in initial research. Generated ideas had different types: some of them were small/cosmetic changes and some were bigger improvements. Additionally I ideated a few new features to the system. Then all generated ideas were prioritized on the impact-effort matrix. And paper sketches were created for the chosen ideas.

In this folder you can find:
* Sturctures list of generated ideas to found problems
* Impact-effort matrix of ideas
* Sketches


### Prototyping

This stage focused on creating interactive prototypes of chosen ideas of enhancement.

In this folder you can find:
* Screenshots of different prototypes’ pages


### Testing

This stage was focused on validating the assumptions made in the prototypes. I conducted one iteration of testing. As a result I compiled a list of enhancements for the next iteration of testing.

In this folder you can find:
* Proof of moderated usability testing
* Document with testing results
* Document with results of SUS evaluation of prototypes
