# Enhancing the Checkout Flow in Silpo Online Store through User-Centered Design.

This is the repository for the thesis project "Enhancing the Checkout Flow in Silpo Online Store through User-Centered Design." completed by Mariia Sitarchuk under the supervision of Kateryna Kamianets.
It is based on the stages of Design Thinking technique, which was used for the project’s workflow.

The result of the project is the set of prototypes of enhanced parts of the Silpo online store app's interface in checkout flow and additional ideas, that were generated based on the users' pains and needs research results.
Here are the links to the resulting prototypes:
* [Prototype 1 - Improving delivery fee understanding in the shopping cart](https://www.figma.com/proto/HQXcJ7cfqYK9MkTMlDtmQs/Design-and...?node-id=241-15272&p=f&t=ml6uA6jq0EkPn1en-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=241%3A15011&starting-point-node-id=241%3A15272).
* [Prototype 2 - Optimization of the action of completely removing an item from the cart](https://www.figma.com/proto/HQXcJ7cfqYK9MkTMlDtmQs/Design-and...?node-id=232-3328&p=f&t=ml6uA6jq0EkPn1en-0&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=229%3A3085&starting-point-node-id=232%3A3328).

## Artefacts

### Empathy
This phase focused on gathering essential insights to understand the existing state of Silpo's online platform and to identify possible user challenges. To achieve this, several key activities were performed: heuristic audit of the Silpo online store's platforms, competitive analysis of other online retailers on market, moderated usability testing and semi-structured interviews with both experienced and novice users, and a broad survey on online grocery shopping habits. 

In this folder you can find:
* Document with the competitors analysis
* Proofs of moderated usability testing and interviews
* Document with the interview scripts for experienced and inexperienced users
* Document with the usability testing scripts for experienced and inexperienced users
* Document with the results of moderated usability testing
* Document with the results of SUS evaluation of system state
* Document with the answers to the survey (in Ukrainian)
* Document with the results of the survey

The results of initial system analysis and heuristic audit can be found in the common Figma Design file in the “As is state” tab.


### Definition

This stage focused on getting the full picture of received information from the previous stage and stating the main problems faced by the user.

In this folder you can find:
* Three user personas of Silpo
* Customer journey maps for focused pathes of use


### Ideation

This stage focused on generating ideas of enhancement based on personas and findings in previous stages. Generated ideas had different types: some of them were small changes in current interface and some were bigger improvements. Additionally a few new features to the system were ideated. Then all generated ideas were prioritized on the Impact-Effort matrix. And paper sketches were created for some ideas.

In this folder you can find:
* List of all generated ideas
* Sturctured list of generated ideas to found problems
* Impact-effort matrix of ideas
* Sketches


### Prototyping

This stage focused on creating interactive prototypes of chosen ideas of enhancement.

In this folder you can find:
* Screenshots of different prototypes’ pages


### Testing

This stage was focused on validating the assumptions made in the prototypes. One iteration of testing was conducted. As a result a list of enhancements for the next iteration of testing was created.

In this folder you can find:
* Proofs of moderated usability testing
* Document with the prototype usability testing scripts
* Document with testing results
* Document with results of SUS evaluation of 3 prototypes of new features ideas
